# movie-rating
This is movie rating project using python.
Movie dataset was downloaded from IMDb (Movie Rating Website).
This dataset contains huge number movies but I considered only first 5000 movies for my movie rating project.
This dataset contains column like movie_id, Num_votes and AverageRating.I have applied one rating formula to find score of each movies based on number of votes and Average rating of each movie.
